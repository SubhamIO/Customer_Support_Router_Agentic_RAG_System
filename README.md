### Intelligent Router Agentic RAG System

This project focuses on building an **Intelligent Router Agentic RAG System** that combines intelligent query analysis, sentiment detection, and dynamic routing with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to handle diverse user inquiries efficiently. The workflow includes the following components:

1. **Query Categorization and Sentiment Analysis**:
   - The system uses **OpenAI GPT-4o** to analyze the user's query and determine:
     - **Query Category**: Identifies the type of problem, such as billing, technical issues, or general queries.
     - **User Sentiment**: Evaluates the user's sentiment (positive, neutral, or negative) to determine if escalation is needed.

2. **Intelligent Routing**:
   - Based on the **query_category** and **query_sentiment**, the system routes the query to the appropriate handling node:
     - **Escalate to Human**: If the sentiment is negative, the query is escalated to a human for resolution.
     - **Generate Billing Response**: Queries related to billing are routed to generate an appropriate response.
     - **Generate Technical Response**: Technical queries are routed for a specialized technical response.
     - **Generate General Response**: General queries are handled with context-aware responses.

3. **Knowledge Base Integration (RAG)**:
   - The system integrates with a **Knowledge Base (Vector Database)** to augment responses with relevant and accurate information.
   - Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) ensures that responses are grounded in the latest and most reliable data.

4. **Escalation Mechanism**:
   - Negative sentiment triggers an **escalation to a human**, ensuring the user receives empathetic and personalized support for critical issues.
